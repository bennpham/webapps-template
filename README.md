# webapps-template
A template I made to use for creating webapps with MySQL and Apache Tomcat 7 in Java.

To use, make sure you do the following:
* Have Apache Tomcat installed and setup. 
* Make sure you have JDK install to compile/write java servlets. 
* Make sure you have MySQL installed to utilize the database.
